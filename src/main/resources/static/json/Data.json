All rebound shall be removed from the area of application as the work progresses and such rebound material shall not be reused.\nviii.   As soon as the freshly shotcreted surface shows the first dry patches, a fine spray of water shall be applied to keep too moist. After the surface has hardened, it shall be kept continuously moist for minimum seven days. If there is extreme heat, especially when accompanied by hot winds, the shotcreted surface, immediately upon completion, shall be covered with burlap or similar covering, which must be kept continuously moist for 14 days after shotcreting. The temperature of the lining shall not be permitted to exceed 38oC during placing and curing.\nNote: 6mm MS Reinforcement and  welded wire mesh as specified shall be used for thickness of Shotcreting above 50mm\n(Supply of cement is in Contractor\u0027s scope unless otherwise specified in BOQ).",
